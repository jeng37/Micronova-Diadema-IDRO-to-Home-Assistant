Diadema IDRO / Total Control app / uncloud to Home Assistant

"uncloud" La Nordica Extraflame Diadema IDRO / NAVEL 2.0 Wifi Modul to Home Assistant.

What has happened so far.

I can still record when something is sent to the stove.
It's just that my programming knowledge is outdated (rusty).
Well, here's what I've found out so far.


Total Control
https://totalcontrol.extraflame.it
or the new one i found in this log,
http://wifi.extraflame.it

I opened the wifi adapter (white label).
And found 3 pins on the ESP32.

GND is drawn, just need to find rx and tx.
So in my case now (Blue = GND, Orange = RX, Yellow = TX)
You need a 3.3v usb2uart.
Note (green is not connected)

Then connect with putty, serial port of usb2uart, baud rate 115200.

I was very surprised that it is an esp32 wroom and there is a partition with spiffs.

Unfortunately I can't make a backup of the esp. I always get the error message
A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.

esptool -p COM7 -b 115200 read_flash 0 0x400000 flash.bin

Instructions [here](https://jmswrnr.com/blog/hacking-a-smart-home-device#dumping-flash)

 
Then based on[
philibertc
Philibert Cheminot ](https://github.com/philibertc/micronova_controller)
i created the controller.
https://github.com/philibertc/micronova_controller/wiki/How-to-build-it

after that,
i got the software from [
Jorre05
Joris S ](https://github.com/Jorre05/micronova)
and installed it on a Wemos d1 mini.
changed some variables and itÂ´s running.

My Stove model is "Extraflame Diadema IDRO"

<br>News:
<br>Added a pellet level sensor.</br>

<br>Hardware components:
<br>Wemos D1 Mini and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
<br>HC-SR04: 
         <br>Vcc to wemos 5v
         <br>Trig to wemos pin D4
         <br>Echo to wemos pin D3
         <br>Gnd to wemos Gnd

<br>Reed sensor: A magnetic switch that closes when a magnet approaches and opens when it moves away.
LED: A simple LED controlled via a GPIO pin of the ESP8266/ESP32.
Resistor: A 220-330 ohm resistor in series with the LED to limit the current.
ESP8266/ESP32: A microcontroller powered by ESPHome.
Wiring:
Reed sensor:

A reed sensor pin to GND.
The other pin to a digital GPIO pin of the ESP (e.g. GPIO14) and at the same time to 3.3V via a pull-up resistor (approx. 10k Ohm).
LED:

Anode (longer pin) of the LED to a GPIO pin of the ESP (e.g. GPIO5) via a 220-330 ohm resistor.
Cathode (shorter pin) of the LED to GND.
