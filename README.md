Total-Control-app-to-HA

"uncloud" Extraflame NAVEL 2.0 Wifi Modul to Home Assistant.

What has happened so far.

I can still record when something is sent to the stove.
It's just that my programming knowledge is outdated (rusty).
Well, here's what I've found out so far.


Total Control
https://totalcontrol.extraflame.it
or the new one i found in this log,
http://wifi.extraflame.it

I opened the wifi adapter (white label).
And found 3 pins on the ESP32.

![ESP32_Pins](https://github.com/jeng37/Total-Control-app-to-HA/assets/12857791/8f61cc9c-6878-4c8d-9441-ce4cbc64a04e)

GND is drawn, just need to find rx and tx.
So in my case now (Blue = GND, Orange = RX, Yellow = TX)
You need a 3.3v usb2uart.
Note (green is not connected)

![ESP32_Usb2UART](https://github.com/jeng37/Total-Control-app-to-HA/assets/12857791/95634655-ef08-4f44-b724-3371b0c79307)

![usb2uart_Pin_Def](https://github.com/jeng37/Total-Control-app-to-HA/assets/12857791/fa2f1ced-ec19-4db5-8c58-adb0dc21e0f7)

Then connect with putty, serial port of usb2uart, baud rate 115200.

I was very surprised that it is an esp32 wroom and there is a partition with spiffs.

Unfortunately I can't make a backup of the esp. I always get the error message
A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.

esptool -p COM7 -b 115200 read_flash 0 0x400000 flash.bin

Then based on[
philibertc
Philibert Cheminot ](https://github.com/philibertc/micronova_controller)
i created the controller.
https://github.com/philibertc/micronova_controller/wiki/How-to-build-it

after that,
i got the software from [
Jorre05
Joris S ](https://github.com/Jorre05/micronova)
and installed it on a Wemos d1 mini.
changed some varialbes and itÂ´s running.
[here] the variables read write locations.
    Read
    0x00 RAM
    0x20 EEPROM

    Write
    0x80 RAM
    0xA0 EEPROM


   read in RAM address: 0000 value: 0x01    // Read Temperature

   write in EEP address: 000C value:65      // Change H2o temperature value to 65 degres
   read in EEP address: 0x20 value: 0x0C    // H2o temperature set
   write in EEP address: 0085 value:1       // Change stove pover to 1 (1 to 5)
   
My Stove model is "Extraflame Diadema IDRO"
